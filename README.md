RSS Aggregator
==============

Copyright (c) 2012 Saul Guardado <seguardado88@gmail.com>

This Python script searches a website given by the user for an RSS feed. If the script successfully finds an RSS link, the script then retrieves all recent posts and reproduces them on a new website (itc.dreamhosters.com/seguardado) for quicker and easier reading.

This is still in early development with new features to be added soon. 

To Do
======

1) Retrieve posts by keywords/tags given by the user
2) Sort posts by date/relevance
3) Option to share post via email, social network, or print
4) User determined post limits

Known Bugs
==========

At the moment, content is sometimes displayed incorrectly. This is not the fault of the script but of PHP. I am currently working on a universal fix for this.
